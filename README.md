Copy the file `delete_old_indices.sh` from the `cron.daily` directory to `/etc/cron.daily` and make the file executable (`chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/delete_old_indices.sh`)

Create the `/opt/tattle_tale` directory `sudo mkdir /opt/tattle_tale`

Copy the `tattle_shadow.py`, `tattle_snmp_poll.py` and `tattle_tale_cfg.py` files to the `/opt/tattle_tale` directory and make `tattle_shadow.py` and `tattle_snmp_poll.py` executable (`chmod 755 <filename>`)

Rename the `netflow.yml.disabled` file to `netflow.yml` in `/etc/filebeat/modules.d`
Enable the filebeat module `sudo filebeat modules enable netflow` 

Edit the `tattle_tale_cfg.py` file and populate these fields:

**These fields will be populated with the email address/password that Shadowserver has assigned to you.  If you don't yet receive Shadowserver reports, you can request them here: https://www.shadowserver.org/contact/

`shadow_user = "<username>"`

`shadow_pass = "<password>"`

**This field is the snmp community string for polling the routers for their interface descriptions

`snmp_community = "<community string>"`


Create the file `/opt/tattle_tale/router_list.txt` and put in the IPs of routers that will be polled (one router per line). 


Restart the ELK stack daemons:
`sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch`
`sudo systemctl restart kibana`
`sudo systemctl restart logstash`
`sudo systemctl restart filebeat`

Make the ELK stack daemons start at boot:
`sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch`
`sudo systemctl enable kibana`
`sudo systemctl enable logstash`
`sudo systemctl enable filebeat`

Open Kibana and click the hamburger button to open up the left side menu.  Click "Stack Management" and then "Index patterns".  
Click the "+Create index pattern" button and put in "netflow*".  
Specify the primary time field as "@timestamp" from the drop down and press the "Create index pattern" button.
